# Ditherr
Ditherr is an imaginery incentive and advertising platform that gives website users a good reason to fill out that nasty web form and hit Submit.

It's not a real thing.

This code is responsive landing page for the service. Built with Bootstrap 4, Some custom CSS and a little JQuery.
All illustrations are original (hence a bit crap).

To run this locally you will need to use some sort of web server (LAMP or Web Server for Chrome).
